# BCG Data Science & Analysis

PowerCo is a significant gas and electricity utility that supplies corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

The project aims to identify the drivers of customer churn, specifically in the SME segment, and develop a predictive model to understand the impact of price sensitivity on churn.

To accomplish this, we have conducted exploratory data analysis on historical customer and pricing data, including usage, sign-up dates, forecasted usage, variable and fixed pricing, and churn indicators. We have also focused on the difference between off-peak prices in December and January of the preceding year as a potential feature.

Using a Random Forest classifier, we have trained a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn. We will evaluate the performance of the model using suitable metrics. I hypothesize that price sensitivity plays a significant role in customer churn, and this model will help us understand which customers are most likely to churn at their current price.

Additionally, we will investigate the effectiveness of a proposed 20% discount strategy to incentivize at-risk customers to stay. Our project aims to provide actionable insights for PowerCo's SME division and support their decision-making process.
